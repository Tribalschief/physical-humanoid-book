# Gazebo Simulation

Gazebo is a 3D dynamic simulator with the ability to accurately and efficiently simulate populations of robots in complex indoor and outdoor environments.

## Why Simulation?
Testing code on a real humanoid robot is dangerous and expensive. If your code has a bug, a $100,000 robot could fall and break. Simulation allows us to crash 1,000 times with zero cost.

## Features
- **Physics Engines**: ODE, Bullet, Simbody, and DART.
- **Sensors**: Laser, Camera, Kinect, etc.
