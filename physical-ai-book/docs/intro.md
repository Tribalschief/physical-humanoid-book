# Introduction to Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics

## Course Overview
The future of work will be a partnership between people, intelligent agents, and robots. This course bridges the gap between digital AI and the physical world.

### Why Physical AI Matters
Humanoid robots are poised to excel in our human-centered world because they share our physical form and can be trained with abundant data from interacting in human environments. This represents a significant transition from AI models confined to digital environments to embodied intelligence that operates in physical space.

### Embodied Intelligence
Embodied intelligence refers to intelligent agents that have a physical body and interact with the physical world. Unlike Chatbots which only process text, Physical AI must process gravity, friction, collisions, and visual depth.

## Hardware Requirements
- **Workstation**: NVIDIA RTX 4070 Ti (12GB) or higher, Intel Core i7 13th Gen, 64GB RAM, Ubuntu 22.04.
- **Edge Computing**: NVIDIA Jetson Orin Nano (8GB) for the robot brain.
- **Sensors**: Intel RealSense D435i (Depth Camera + IMU), ReSpeaker Mic Array.
- **Robot**: Unitree Go2 (Quadruped) or G1 (Humanoid) for Sim-to-Real transfer.
